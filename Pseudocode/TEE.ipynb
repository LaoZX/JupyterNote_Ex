    "During the registration phase, an IoT device initiates the onboarding process by submitting a registration request containing basic device information, such as its identifier and manufacturer-related metadata, to a nearby fog node. To protect sensitive registration data from exposure, the fog node forwards the received information to its Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) enclave using a secure channel encrypted with the enclave’s public key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the TEE, the fog node verifies the device’s legitimacy by validating manufacturer certificates, firmware signatures, and administrative records with the assistance of attribute authorities. Based on the verified evidence, the enclave assigns a set of attributes to the IoT device, including static attributes (e.g., device type and manufacturer), administrative attributes (e.g., ownership domain and deployment zone), and dynamic attributes (e.g., security level). To ensure integrity and auditability, cryptographic hashes of the assigned attributes, together with issuer information and timestamps, are recorded on the blockchain through the attribute provider contract.\n",

    "The complete attribute set is then encrypted using an enclave-protected symmetric key and stored locally on the fog node outside the enclave, preventing leakage even if the fog operating system is compromised. To enhance system reliability and fault tolerance, the fog node periodically backs up the encrypted attributes to a trusted cloud-based data storage service. Finally, upon successful completion of the registration process, the fog node notifies the IoT device of its registration status and enables it to request access to system resources in subsequent phases.\n"
