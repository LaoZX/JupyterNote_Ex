    "## Intro\n",
    "### Contribution\n",
    "1. propose a TEE and blockchain assisted cross domain authorization system.\n",
    "2. abac based dynamic iot cross-domain authorization (ABAC is dynamic because access decisions are evaluated at runtime based on current attribute values, not static role assignments.)\n",
    "3. experiment to evaluate proposed system's performance\n",

    "#### Scalability in Large-Scale IoT Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "In IoT environments:\n",
    "- devices are numerous\n",
    "- identities are dynamic\n",
    "- cross-domain access is common\n",
    "\n",
    "IBS requires:\n",
    "- tight coupling between identity and access rights\n",
    "- frequent key updates when permissions change\n",
    "\n",
    "ABAC decouples:\n",
    "- identity management\n",
    "- access policies\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows policies to evolve without reissuing identities or keys, significantly improving scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cross-Domain Authorization Support\n",
    "\n",
    "IBS-based systems assume a single trusted Private Key Generator (PKG) or tightly coordinated PKGs across domains.\n",
    "Problems:\n",
    "- PKG trust becomes a bottleneck\n",
    "- cross-domain trust establishment is complex\n",
    "- key escrow issues arise\n",
    "\n",
    "ABAC enables:\n",
    "- attribute verification across domains\n",
    "- policy enforcement without shared identity infrastructure\n",
    "- blockchain-backed attribute provenance\n",
    "\n",
    "This aligns naturally with your cross-domain fog–blockchain architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reduced Key Management Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "IBS introduces:\n",
    "- key escrow risk (PKG knows private keys)\n",
    "- heavy cryptographic operations (pairings)\n",
    "- complex revocation mechanisms\n",
    "\n",
    "ABAC:\n",
    "- uses standard public-key authentication for identity\n",
    "- assigns attributes independently\n",
    "- supports policy updates without rekeying\n",
    "\n",
    "This is more suitable for resource-constrained IoT devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Security Policy Evolution\n",
    "\n",
    "IoT systems evolve:\n",
    "- devices change roles\n",
    "- policies change frequently\n",
    "- context changes dynamically\n",
    "\n",
    "With IBS:\n",
    "- permission changes require identity-level changes\n",
    "- revocation is coarse-grained\n",
    "\n",
    "With ABAC:\n",
    "- attributes can be updated or revoked\n",
    "- policies evolve independently\n",
    "- authorization remains deterministic and auditable\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Compatibility with TEE-Based Enforcement\n",
    "\n",
    "ABAC policy evaluation:\n",
    "- is deterministic\n",
    "- operates on structured inputs\n",
    "- fits well inside TEE execution\n",
    "\n",
    "IBS:\n",
    "- only verifies cryptographic signatures\n",
    "- cannot express or enforce policies inside the enclave\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, ABAC integrates naturally with your TEE-based authorization design."

Fog node: They are (Fog Nodes Are Blockchain Validators / Peers, which Propose transactions (registration, revocation); Validate transactions from other fog nodes; Reach consensus on block ordering; Store replicated ledger copies) partially trusted, means they may be OS-level compromised or exist malicious insiders, but the Trusted Execution Environment on each fog node is assumed to be secure and provides hardware-enforced isolation. Fog nodes in each domain jointly maintain a blockchain and manage Iot devices in the domain. It deploys TEE and runs smart contracts in the enclave. It can be treated as a Attribute Authority in the ABAC system. It also store registered iots' info(attributes/access policies) securitly and back up those info to cloud.\n",
    "2. Iot node: They play the role of resource providers or consumer or both in the domain and untrusted. The computing and storage capacity is relatively weaker than the Fogs. It may ask access of other devices or resources inide or outside its own domain.\n",
    "3. Cloud/DDS: The cloud-based Dedicated Data Storage (DDS) acts as a trusted, robust backend storage service. Unlike traditional centralized authorization servers, the cloud/DDS does not participate in real-time authentication or authorization decisions. Instead, it provides durability, recoverability, and global availability for authorization-related data. In addition to serving as a trusted storage backend, the cloud can also act as a resource provider(application services, analytics, historical data, resources that IoT devices may want to access). Access to cloud-hosted resources is also authorized by fog nodes, while the cloud enforces access by verifying short-lived authorization tokens without participating in policy evaluation.\n",
    "4. blockchain: Serve as a global distributed ledger, the blockchain in this system carries the information of different domains which will be used for cross-domain authentication.

We use Intel SGX as the TEE in our experiments. Our version of Intel SGX SDK and Intel SGX PSW for is v2.10.100.2. We use C and the PBC library to complete the encryption and signature algorithm in our protocol, which allows the computation of bilinear pairs. The version of pbc library we use in our experiments is pbc-0.5.14. Since pbc is not a trusted library for intel SGX, which means it is not possible to call functions belong to the pbc library directly in the enclave, so we use the ECALL/OCALL interface to call external functions for our experiments. We chose the curve in type F parameter provided by the pbc library for our experiments which can provide the asymmetric bilinear pairs.\n",
