Every day, there appears to be a plethora of news. A war of competitor chatbots is raging amidst an AI arms race and gold rush. These rapid developments impact higher education, as millions of students and academics have started using bots like ChatGPT, Bing Chat, Bard, Ernie and others for a large variety of purposes. In this article, we select some of the most promising chatbots in the English and Chinese-language spaces and provide their corporate backgrounds and brief histories. Following an up-to-date review of the Chinese and English-language academic literature, we describe our comparative method and systematically compare selected chatbots across a multi-disciplinary test relevant to higher education. The results of our test show that there are currently no A-students and no B-students in this bot cohort, despite all publicised and sensationalist claims to the contrary. The much-vaunted AI is not yet that intelligent, it would appear. GPT-4 and its predecessor did best, whilst Bing Chat and Bard were akin to at-risk students with F-grade averages. We conclude our article with four types of recommendations for key stakeholders in higher education: (1) faculty in terms of assessment and (2) teaching & learning, (3) students and (4) higher education institutions. © 2023.

Development professionals help train teachers and get teachers to participate in studies. The platform and these teachers help researchers (sometimes explicitly and sometimes implicitly) simply by using content the teacher selects. The platform, hosted by Worcester Polytechnic Institute, allows teachers to write individual ASSISTments (composed of questions with answers and associated hints, solutions, web-based videos, etc.) or to use pre-built ASSISTments, bundle them together in a problem set, and assign these to students. The system gives immediate feedback to students while they are working and provides student-level data to teachers on any assignment. The word ""ASSISTments"" blends tutoring ""assistance"" with ""assessment"" reporting to teachers and students. While originally focused on mathematics, the platform now has content from many other subjects (e.g.; science, English, Statistics, etc.). Due to the large library of mathematics content, however, it is mostly used by math teachers. Over 50,000 students used ASSISTments last school year (2013-4) and this number has been doubling each year for the last 8 years. The platform allows any user, mostly researchers, to create randomized controlled trials in the content, which has helped us use the tool in over 18 published and an equal number of unpublished studies. The data collected by the system has also been used in a few dozen peer-reviewed data mining publications. This paper will not seek to review these publications, but instead we will share why ASSISTments has been successful and what lessons were learned along the way. The first lesson learned was to build a platform for learning sciences, not a product that focused on a math topic. That is, ASSISTments is a tool, not a curriculum. A second lesson learned is expressed by the mantra ""Put the teacher in charge, not the computer."" This second lesson is about building a flexible system that allows teachers to use the tool in concert with the classroom routine. Once teachers are using the tool they are more likely to want to participate in research studies. These lessons were born from the design decisions about what the platform supports and does not support. In conclusion, goals for the future will be presented. © 2014 International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.","Authoring tool; Controlled experiment; Formative assessment; Intelligent tutoring System; RCT","Computer aided instruction; Curricula; Data mining; Ecosystems; Education computing; Students; Authoring tool; Controlled experiment; Formative assessment; Immediate feedbacks; Intelligent tutoring system; Minimally invasive; Platform for learning; Randomized controlled trial; Teaching","","","","","GAANN; US Dept of Education, (305A07440, 305A120125, 305C100024, R305K03140); National Science Foundation, NSF, (0231773, 0448319, 0742503, 1031398, 1109483); Office of Naval Research, ONR; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, BMGF; Spencer Foundation; Educause","Acknowledgments We would like to thank all the 150+ students at WPI that helped us create ASSISTments, and then do research with it.

Whilst it has been around for about 30 years, it is still unclear for educators how to make pedagogical advantage of it on a broader scale, and how it can actually impact meaningfully on teaching and learning in higher education. This paper seeks to provide an overview of research on AI applications in higher education through a systematic review. Out of 2656 initially identified publications for the period between 2007 and 2018, 146 articles were included for final synthesis, according to explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria. The descriptive results show that most of the disciplines involved in AIEd papers come from Computer Science and STEM, and that quantitative methods were the most frequently used in empirical studies. The synthesis of results presents four areas of AIEd applications in academic support services, and institutional and administrative services: 1. profiling and prediction, 2. assessment and evaluation, 3. adaptive systems and personalisation, and 4. intelligent tutoring systems. The conclusions reflect on the almost lack of critical reflection of challenges and risks of AIEd, the weak connection to theoretical pedagogical perspectives, and the need for further exploration of ethical and educational approaches in the application of AIEd in higher education. © 2019, The Author(s).","Artificial intelligence; Higher education; Intelligent tutoring systems; Machine learning; Systematic review","","","","","","","","Acikkar M., Akay M.F., Support vector machines for predicting the admission decision of a candidate to the School of Physical Education and Sports at Cukurova University, Expert Systems with Applications, 36, 3, pp. 7228-7233, (2009); Adamson D., Dyke G., Jang H., Rose C.P., Towards an agile approach to adapting dynamic collaboration support to student needs, International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 24, 1, pp. 92-124, (2014); Agaoglu M., Predicting instructor performance using data mining techniques in higher education, IEEE Access, 4, pp. 2379-2387, (2016); Ahmad H., Rashid T., Lecturer performance analysis using multiple classifiers, Journal of Computer Science, 12, 5, pp. 255-264, (2016); Alfarsi G.M.S., Omar K.A.M., Alsinani M.J., A rule-based system for advising undergraduate students, Journal of Theoretical and Applied Information Technology, 95, 11, (2017); Alkhasawneh R., Hargraves R.H., Developing a hybrid model to predict student first year retention in STEM disciplines using machine learning techniques, Journal of STEM Education: Innovations & Research, 15, 3, pp. 35-42, (2014); Aluko R.O., Adenuga O.A., Kukoyi P.O., Soyingbe A.A., Oyedeji J.O., Predicting the academic success of architecture students by pre-enrolment requirement: Using machine-learning techniques, Construction Economics and Building, 16, 4, pp. 86-98, (2016); Aluthman E.S., The effect of using automated essay evaluation on ESL undergraduate students’ writing skill, International Journal of English Linguistics, 6, 5, pp. 54-67, (2016); Amigud A., Arnedo-Moreno J., Daradoumis T., Guerrero-Roldan A.-E., Using learning analytics for preserving academic integrity, International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning, 18, 5, pp. 192-210, (2017); Andris C., Cowen D., Wittenbach J., Support vector machine for spatial variation, Transactions in GIS, 17, 1, pp. 41-61, (2013); Aparicio F., Morales-Botello M.L., Rubio M., Hernando A., Munoz R., Lopez-Fernandez H., Et al., Perceptions of the use of intelligent information access systems in university level active learning activities among teachers of biomedical subjects, International Journal of Medical Informatics, 112, December 2017, pp. 21-33, (2018); Babic I.D., Machine learning methods in predicting the student academic motivation, Croatian Operational Research Review, 8, 2, pp. 443-461, (2017); Bahadir E., Using neural network and logistic regression analysis to predict prospective mathematics teachers’ academic success upon entering graduate education, Kuram ve Uygulamada Egitim Bilimleri, 16, 3, pp. 943-964, (2016); Bakeman R., Gottman J.M., Observing interaction - an introduction to sequential analysis, (1997); Baker R.S., Stupid Tutoring Systems, Intelligent Humans, International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 26, 2, pp. 600-614, (2016); Baker T., Smith L., Educ-AI-tion rebooted?

In the standard BKT implementation, there are only skill-specific parameters. However, a large body of research strongly suggests that student-specific variability in the data, when accounted for, could enhance model accuracy [5,6,8]. In this work, we revisit the problem of introducing student-specific parameters into BKT on a larger scale. We show that student-specific parameters lead to a tangible improvement when predicting the data of unseen students, and that parameterizing students' speed of learning is more beneficial than parameterizing a priori knowledge. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Bayesian knowledge tracing; Model fitting; Model selection; Student-specific model parameters","Artificial intelligence; Computer aided instruction; Education computing; Bayesian knowledge tracings; Intelligent tutoring system; Model accuracy; Model fitting; Model parameters; Model Selection; Parameterizing; Priori knowledge; Students","","","","","","","Corbett A.T., Anderson J.R., Knowledge tracing: Modeling the acquisition of procedural knowledge, User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction, 4, 4, pp. 253-278, (1995); Levinson S.E., Rabiner L.R., Sondhi M.M., An introduction to the application of the theory of probabilistic functions of a markov process to automatic speech recognition, Bell System Technical Journal, 62, 4, pp. 1035-1074, (1983); Van Der Linden W.J., Hambleton R.K., Handbook of Modern Item Response Theory, (1997); Yudelson M., Pavlik Jr. I.P., Koedinger K.R., User modeling-A notoriously black art, UMAP 2011.

Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the performance of ChatGPT on questions within the scope of the United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 and Step 2 exams, as well as to analyze responses for user interpretability. Methods: We used 2 sets of multiple-choice questions to evaluate ChatGPT’s performance, each with questions pertaining to Step 1 and Step 2. The first set was derived from AMBOSS, a commonly used question bank for medical students, which also provides statistics on question difficulty and the performance on an exam relative to the user base. The second set was the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) free 120 questions. ChatGPT’s performance was compared to 2 other large language models, GPT-3 and InstructGPT. The text output of each ChatGPT response was evaluated across 3 qualitative metrics: logical justification of the answer selected, presence of information internal to the question, and presence of information external to the question. Results: Of the 4 data sets, AMBOSS-Step1, AMBOSS-Step2, NBME-Free-Step1, and NBME-Free-Step2, ChatGPT achieved accuracies of 44% (44/100), 42% (42/100), 64.4% (56/87), and 57.8% (59/102), respectively. ChatGPT outperformed InstructGPT by 8.15% on average across all data sets, and GPT-3 performed similarly to random chance. The model demonstrated a significant decrease in performance as question difficulty increased (P=.01) within the AMBOSS-Step1 data set. We found that logical justification for ChatGPT’s answer selection was present in 100% of outputs of the NBME data sets. Internal information to the question was present in 96.8% (183/189) of all questions. The presence of information external to the question was 44.5% and 27% lower for incorrect answers relative to correct answers on the NBME-Free-Step1 (P<.001) and NBME-Free-Step2 (P=.001) data sets, respectively. Conclusions: ChatGPT marks a significant improvement in natural language processing models on the tasks of medical question answering. By performing at a greater than 60% threshold on the NBME-Free-Step-1 data set, we show that the model achieves the equivalent of a passing score for a third-year medical student. Additionally, we highlight ChatGPT’s capacity to provide logic and informational context across the majority of answers.

An inverted (or flipped) classroom is a specific type of blended learning design that uses technology to move lectures outside the classroom and uses learning activities to move practice with concepts inside the classroom. This article compares the learning environments of an inverted introductory statistics class with a traditional introductory statistics class at the same university. This mixed-methods research study used the College and University Classroom Environment Inventory (CUCEI), field notes, interviews and focus groups to investigate the learning environments of these two classrooms. Students in the inverted classroom were less satisfied with how the classroom structure oriented them to the learning tasks in the course, but they became more open to cooperative learning and innovative teaching methods. These findings are discussed in terms of how they contribute to the stability and connectedness of classroom learning communities. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Blended learning; Classroom flip;

As we reflect on our past and shape our future, we ask two main questions: What are our major strengths? And, what new opportunities lay on the horizon? We analyse 47 papers from three years in the history of the Journal of AIED (1994, 2004, and 2014) to identify the foci and typical scenarios that occupy the field of AIED. We use those results to suggest two parallel strands of research that need to take place in order to impact education in the next 25 years: One is an evolutionary process, focusing on current classroom practices, collaborating with teachers, and diversifying technologies and domains. The other is a revolutionary process where we argue for embedding our technologies within students' everyday lives, supporting their cultures, practices, goals, and communities. © 2016 International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.","Artificial intelligence in education;

Learner models are now embedded in real world applications which can claim to have thousands, or even hundreds of thousands, of users. Probabilistic models for skill assessment are playing a key role in these advanced learning environments. In this paper, we review the learner models that have played the largest roles in the success of these learning environments, and also the latest advances in the modeling and assessment of learner skills. We conclude by discussing related advancements in modeling other key constructs such as learner motivation, emotional and attentional state, meta-cognition and self-regulated learning, group learning, and the recent movement towards open and shared learner models. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Bayesian Knowledge Tracing; Bayesian Networks; Cognitive modeling; Intelligent Tutoring System; IRT; Learner models; Learning environments; Model tracing; POKS; Probabilistic models; Student models","Bayesian networks; Cognitive systems; Computer aided instruction; Education computing; Research laboratories; Bayesian Knowledge Tracing; Cognitive modeling; Intelligent tutoring system; IRT; Learner model; Learning environments; POKS; Probabilistic models; Student models; Students","","","","","","","Aleven V., McLaren B.M., Roll I., Koedinger K.R., Toward meta-cognitive tutoring: A model of help seeking with a cognitive tutor, I.

Chan School of Public Health, Harvard University, Boston, MA, United States","Background: Conversational agents, also known as chatbots, are computer programs designed to simulate human text or verbal conversations. They are increasingly used in a range of fields, including health care. By enabling better accessibility, personalization, and efficiency, conversational agents have the potential to improve patient care. Objective: This study aimed to review the current applications, gaps, and challenges in the literature on conversational agents in health care and provide recommendations for their future research, design, and application. Methods: We performed a scoping review. A broad literature search was performed in MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online; Ovid), EMBASE (Excerpta Medica database; Ovid), PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Central with the search terms ""conversational agents,"" ""conversational AI,"" ""chatbots,"" and associated synonyms. We also searched the gray literature using sources such as the OCLC (Online Computer Library Center) WorldCat database and ResearchGate in April 2019. Reference lists of relevant articles were checked for further articles. Screening and data extraction were performed in parallel by 2 reviewers. The included evidence was analyzed narratively by employing the principles of thematic analysis. Results: The literature search yielded 47 study reports (45 articles and 2 ongoing clinical trials) that matched the inclusion criteria. The identified conversational agents were largely delivered via smartphone apps (n=23) and used free text only as the main input (n=19) and output (n=30) modality. Case studies describing chatbot development (n=18) were the most prevalent, and only 11 randomized controlled trials were identified. The 3 most commonly reported conversational agent applications in the literature were treatment and monitoring, health care service support, and patient education. Conclusions: The literature on conversational agents in health care is largely descriptive and aimed at treatment and monitoring and health service support. It mostly reports on text-based, artificial intelligence-driven, and smartphone app-delivered conversational agents. There is an urgent need for a robust evaluation of diverse health care conversational agents' formats, focusing on their acceptability, safety, and effectiveness. © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

The tutor uses a commercial eye tracker to monitor a students gaze patterns and identify when the student is bored, disengaged, or is zoning out. The tutor then attempts to reengage the student with dialog moves that direct the student to reorient his or her attentional patterns towards the animated pedagogical agent embodying the tutor. We evaluated the efficacy of the gaze-reactive tutor in promoting learning, motivation, and engagement in a controlled experiment where 48 students were tutored on four biology topics with both gaze-reactive and non-gaze-reactive (control condition) versions of the tutor. The results indicated that: (a) gaze-sensitive dialogs were successful in dynamically reorienting students' attentional patterns to the important areas of the interface, (b) gaze-reactivity was effective in promoting learning gains for questions that required deep reasoning, (c) gaze-reactivity had minimal impact on students' state motivation and on self-reported engagement, and (d) individual differences in scholastic aptitude moderated the impact of gaze-reactivity on overall learning gains. We discuss the implications of our findings, limitations, future work, and consider the possibility of using gaze-reactive ITSs in classrooms. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Affect-sensitive ITS; Affective computing; Boredom; Disengagement; Eye tracking; Gaze-sensitive dialogs; Intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs); Zoning out","Computer aided instruction; Education computing; Interface states; Motivation; Students; Zoning; Affect-sensitive ITS; Affective Computing; Boredom; Disengagement; Eye-tracking; Gaze-sensitive dialogs; Intelligent tutoring system; Teaching","","","","","US Department of Education; National Science Foundation, NSF, (DRL 1108845, HCC 0834847); National Science Foundation, NSF; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE, (R305A080594); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Institute of Education Sciences, IES","This research was supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) ( HCC 0834847 and DRL 1108845 ) and Institute of Education Sciences (IES), US Department of Education (DoE) , through Grant R305A080594 .
