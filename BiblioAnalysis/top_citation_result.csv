Whilst it has been around for about 30 years, it is still unclear for educators how to make pedagogical advantage of it on a broader scale, and how it can actually impact meaningfully on teaching and learning in higher education. This paper seeks to provide an overview of research on AI applications in higher education through a systematic review. Out of 2656 initially identified publications for the period between 2007 and 2018, 146 articles were included for final synthesis, according to explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria. The descriptive results show that most of the disciplines involved in AIEd papers come from Computer Science and STEM, and that quantitative methods were the most frequently used in empirical studies. The synthesis of results presents four areas of AIEd applications in academic support services, and institutional and administrative services: 1. profiling and prediction, 2. assessment and evaluation, 3. adaptive systems and personalisation, and 4. intelligent tutoring systems. The conclusions reflect on the almost lack of critical reflection of challenges and risks of AIEd, the weak connection to theoretical pedagogical perspectives, and the need for further exploration of ethical and educational approaches in the application of AIEd in higher education. © 2019, The Author(s).",Artificial intelligence; Higher education; Intelligent tutoring systems; Machine learning; Systematic review,,,,,,,,"Acikkar M., Akay M.F., Support vector machines for predicting the admission decision of a candidate to the School of Physical Education and Sports at Cukurova University, Expert Systems with Applications, 36, 3, pp. 7228-7233, (2009); Adamson D., Dyke G., Jang H., Rose C.P., Towards an agile approach to adapting dynamic collaboration support to student needs, International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 24, 1, pp. 92-124, (2014); Agaoglu M., Predicting instructor performance using data mining techniques in higher education, IEEE Access, 4, pp. 2379-2387, (2016); Ahmad H., Rashid T., Lecturer performance analysis using multiple classifiers, Journal of Computer Science, 12, 5, pp. 255-264, (2016); Alfarsi G.M.S., Omar K.A.M., Alsinani M.J., A rule-based system for advising undergraduate students, Journal of Theoretical and Applied Information Technology, 95, 11, (2017); Alkhasawneh R., Hargraves R.H., Developing a hybrid model to predict student first year retention in STEM disciplines using machine learning techniques, Journal of STEM Education: Innovations & Research, 15, 3, pp. 35-42, (2014); Aluko R.O., Adenuga O.A., Kukoyi P.O., Soyingbe A.A., Oyedeji J.O., Predicting the academic success of architecture students by pre-enrolment requirement: Using machine-learning techniques, Construction Economics and Building, 16, 4, pp. 86-98, (2016); Aluthman E.S., The effect of using automated essay evaluation on ESL undergraduate students’ writing skill, International Journal of English Linguistics, 6, 5, pp. 54-67, (2016); Amigud A., Arnedo-Moreno J., Daradoumis T., Guerrero-Roldan A.-E., Using learning analytics for preserving academic integrity, International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning, 18, 5, pp. 192-210, (2017); Andris C., Cowen D., Wittenbach J., Support vector machine for spatial variation, Transactions in GIS, 17, 1, pp. 41-61, (2013); Aparicio F., Morales-Botello M.L., Rubio M., Hernando A., Munoz R., Lopez-Fernandez H., Et al., Perceptions of the use of intelligent information access systems in university level active learning activities among teachers of biomedical subjects, International Journal of Medical Informatics, 112, December 2017, pp. 21-33, (2018); Babic I.D., Machine learning methods in predicting the student academic motivation, Croatian Operational Research Review, 8, 2, pp. 443-461, (2017); Bahadir E., Using neural network and logistic regression analysis to predict prospective mathematics teachers’ academic success upon entering graduate education, Kuram ve Uygulamada Egitim Bilimleri, 16, 3, pp. 943-964, (2016); Bakeman R., Gottman J.M., Observing interaction - an introduction to sequential analysis, (1997); Baker R.S., Stupid Tutoring Systems, Intelligent Humans, International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 26, 2, pp. 600-614, (2016); Baker T., Smith L., Educ-AI-tion rebooted?

An inverted (or flipped) classroom is a specific type of blended learning design that uses technology to move lectures outside the classroom and uses learning activities to move practice with concepts inside the classroom. This article compares the learning environments of an inverted introductory statistics class with a traditional introductory statistics class at the same university. This mixed-methods research study used the College and University Classroom Environment Inventory (CUCEI), field notes, interviews and focus groups to investigate the learning environments of these two classrooms. Students in the inverted classroom were less satisfied with how the classroom structure oriented them to the learning tasks in the course, but they became more open to cooperative learning and innovative teaching methods. These findings are discussed in terms of how they contribute to the stability and connectedness of classroom learning communities. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Blended learning; Classroom flip;

Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the performance of ChatGPT on questions within the scope of the United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 and Step 2 exams, as well as to analyze responses for user interpretability. Methods: We used 2 sets of multiple-choice questions to evaluate ChatGPT’s performance, each with questions pertaining to Step 1 and Step 2. The first set was derived from AMBOSS, a commonly used question bank for medical students, which also provides statistics on question difficulty and the performance on an exam relative to the user base. The second set was the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) free 120 questions. ChatGPT’s performance was compared to 2 other large language models, GPT-3 and InstructGPT. The text output of each ChatGPT response was evaluated across 3 qualitative metrics: logical justification of the answer selected, presence of information internal to the question, and presence of information external to the question. Results: Of the 4 data sets, AMBOSS-Step1, AMBOSS-Step2, NBME-Free-Step1, and NBME-Free-Step2, ChatGPT achieved accuracies of 44% (44/100), 42% (42/100), 64.4% (56/87), and 57.8% (59/102), respectively. ChatGPT outperformed InstructGPT by 8.15% on average across all data sets, and GPT-3 performed similarly to random chance. The model demonstrated a significant decrease in performance as question difficulty increased (P=.01) within the AMBOSS-Step1 data set. We found that logical justification for ChatGPT’s answer selection was present in 100% of outputs of the NBME data sets. Internal information to the question was present in 96.8% (183/189) of all questions. The presence of information external to the question was 44.5% and 27% lower for incorrect answers relative to correct answers on the NBME-Free-Step1 (P<.001) and NBME-Free-Step2 (P=.001) data sets, respectively. Conclusions: ChatGPT marks a significant improvement in natural language processing models on the tasks of medical question answering. By performing at a greater than 60% threshold on the NBME-Free-Step-1 data set, we show that the model achieves the equivalent of a passing score for a third-year medical student. Additionally, we highlight ChatGPT’s capacity to provide logic and informational context across the majority of answers. These facts taken together make a compelling case for the potential applications of ChatGPT as an interactive medical education tool to support learning. ©Aidan Gilson, Conrad W Safranek, Thomas Huang, Vimig Socrates, Ling Chi, Richard Andrew Taylor, David Chartash.",artificial intelligence; chatbot; ChatGPT; conversational agent; education technology; generative pre-trained transformer; GPT; machine learning; medical education; MedQA; natural language processing; NLP,,,,,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH, (T35DK104689); National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, NIDDK; Yale School of Medicine, YSM",This publication was made possible by the Yale School of Medicine Fellowship for Medical Student Research.

As we reflect on our past and shape our future, we ask two main questions: What are our major strengths? And, what new opportunities lay on the horizon? We analyse 47 papers from three years in the history of the Journal of AIED (1994, 2004, and 2014) to identify the foci and typical scenarios that occupy the field of AIED. We use those results to suggest two parallel strands of research that need to take place in order to impact education in the next 25 years: One is an evolutionary process, focusing on current classroom practices, collaborating with teachers, and diversifying technologies and domains. The other is a revolutionary process where we argue for embedding our technologies within students' everyday lives, supporting their cultures, practices, goals, and communities. © 2016 International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.",Artificial intelligence in education;

Development professionals help train teachers and get teachers to participate in studies. The platform and these teachers help researchers (sometimes explicitly and sometimes implicitly) simply by using content the teacher selects. The platform, hosted by Worcester Polytechnic Institute, allows teachers to write individual ASSISTments (composed of questions with answers and associated hints, solutions, web-based videos, etc.) or to use pre-built ASSISTments, bundle them together in a problem set, and assign these to students. The system gives immediate feedback to students while they are working and provides student-level data to teachers on any assignment. The word ""ASSISTments"" blends tutoring ""assistance"" with ""assessment"" reporting to teachers and students. While originally focused on mathematics, the platform now has content from many other subjects (e.g.; science, English, Statistics, etc.). Due to the large library of mathematics content, however, it is mostly used by math teachers. Over 50,000 students used ASSISTments last school year (2013-4) and this number has been doubling each year for the last 8 years. The platform allows any user, mostly researchers, to create randomized controlled trials in the content, which has helped us use the tool in over 18 published and an equal number of unpublished studies. The data collected by the system has also been used in a few dozen peer-reviewed data mining publications. This paper will not seek to review these publications, but instead we will share why ASSISTments has been successful and what lessons were learned along the way. The first lesson learned was to build a platform for learning sciences, not a product that focused on a math topic. That is, ASSISTments is a tool, not a curriculum. A second lesson learned is expressed by the mantra ""Put the teacher in charge, not the computer."" This second lesson is about building a flexible system that allows teachers to use the tool in concert with the classroom routine. Once teachers are using the tool they are more likely to want to participate in research studies. These lessons were born from the design decisions about what the platform supports and does not support. In conclusion, goals for the future will be presented. © 2014 International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.",Authoring tool; Controlled experiment; Formative assessment; Intelligent tutoring System; RCT,Computer aided instruction; Curricula; Data mining; Ecosystems; Education computing; Students; Authoring tool; Controlled experiment; Formative assessment; Immediate feedbacks; Intelligent tutoring system; Minimally invasive; Platform for learning; Randomized controlled trial; Teaching,,,,,"GAANN; US Dept of Education, (305A07440, 305A120125, 305C100024, R305K03140); National Science Foundation, NSF, (0231773, 0448319, 0742503, 1031398, 1109483); Office of Naval Research, ONR; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, BMGF; Spencer Foundation; Educause","Acknowledgments We would like to thank all the 150+ students at WPI that helped us create ASSISTments, and then do research with it.

In the standard BKT implementation, there are only skill-specific parameters. However, a large body of research strongly suggests that student-specific variability in the data, when accounted for, could enhance model accuracy [5,6,8]. In this work, we revisit the problem of introducing student-specific parameters into BKT on a larger scale. We show that student-specific parameters lead to a tangible improvement when predicting the data of unseen students, and that parameterizing students' speed of learning is more beneficial than parameterizing a priori knowledge. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Bayesian knowledge tracing; Model fitting; Model selection; Student-specific model parameters,Artificial intelligence; Computer aided instruction; Education computing; Bayesian knowledge tracings; Intelligent tutoring system; Model accuracy; Model fitting; Model parameters; Model Selection; Parameterizing; Priori knowledge; Students,,,,,,,"Corbett A.T., Anderson J.R., Knowledge tracing: Modeling the acquisition of procedural knowledge, User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction, 4, 4, pp. 253-278, (1995); Levinson S.E., Rabiner L.R., Sondhi M.M., An introduction to the application of the theory of probabilistic functions of a markov process to automatic speech recognition, Bell System Technical Journal, 62, 4, pp. 1035-1074, (1983); Van Der Linden W.J., Hambleton R.K., Handbook of Modern Item Response Theory, (1997); Yudelson M., Pavlik Jr. I.P., Koedinger K.R., User modeling-A notoriously black art, UMAP 2011.

Learner models are now embedded in real world applications which can claim to have thousands, or even hundreds of thousands, of users. Probabilistic models for skill assessment are playing a key role in these advanced learning environments. In this paper, we review the learner models that have played the largest roles in the success of these learning environments, and also the latest advances in the modeling and assessment of learner skills. We conclude by discussing related advancements in modeling other key constructs such as learner motivation, emotional and attentional state, meta-cognition and self-regulated learning, group learning, and the recent movement towards open and shared learner models. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Bayesian Knowledge Tracing; Bayesian Networks; Cognitive modeling; Intelligent Tutoring System; IRT; Learner models; Learning environments; Model tracing; POKS; Probabilistic models; Student models,Bayesian networks; Cognitive systems; Computer aided instruction; Education computing; Research laboratories; Bayesian Knowledge Tracing; Cognitive modeling; Intelligent tutoring system; IRT; Learner model; Learning environments; POKS; Probabilistic models; Student models; Students,,,,,,,"Aleven V., McLaren B.M., Roll I., Koedinger K.R., Toward meta-cognitive tutoring: A model of help seeking with a cognitive tutor, I.

Every day, there appears to be a plethora of news. A war of competitor chatbots is raging amidst an AI arms race and gold rush. These rapid developments impact higher education, as millions of students and academics have started using bots like ChatGPT, Bing Chat, Bard, Ernie and others for a large variety of purposes. In this article, we select some of the most promising chatbots in the English and Chinese-language spaces and provide their corporate backgrounds and brief histories. Following an up-to-date review of the Chinese and English-language academic literature, we describe our comparative method and systematically compare selected chatbots across a multi-disciplinary test relevant to higher education. The results of our test show that there are currently no A-students and no B-students in this bot cohort, despite all publicised and sensationalist claims to the contrary. The much-vaunted AI is not yet that intelligent, it would appear. GPT-4 and its predecessor did best, whilst Bing Chat and Bard were akin to at-risk students with F-grade averages. We conclude our article with four types of recommendations for key stakeholders in higher education: (1) faculty in terms of assessment and (2) teaching & learning, (3) students and (4) higher education institutions. © 2023.

Chan School of Public Health, Harvard University, Boston, MA, United States","Background: Conversational agents, also known as chatbots, are computer programs designed to simulate human text or verbal conversations. They are increasingly used in a range of fields, including health care. By enabling better accessibility, personalization, and efficiency, conversational agents have the potential to improve patient care. Objective: This study aimed to review the current applications, gaps, and challenges in the literature on conversational agents in health care and provide recommendations for their future research, design, and application. Methods: We performed a scoping review. A broad literature search was performed in MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online; Ovid), EMBASE (Excerpta Medica database; Ovid), PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Central with the search terms ""conversational agents,"" ""conversational AI,"" ""chatbots,"" and associated synonyms. We also searched the gray literature using sources such as the OCLC (Online Computer Library Center) WorldCat database and ResearchGate in April 2019. Reference lists of relevant articles were checked for further articles. Screening and data extraction were performed in parallel by 2 reviewers. The included evidence was analyzed narratively by employing the principles of thematic analysis. Results: The literature search yielded 47 study reports (45 articles and 2 ongoing clinical trials) that matched the inclusion criteria. The identified conversational agents were largely delivered via smartphone apps (n=23) and used free text only as the main input (n=19) and output (n=30) modality. Case studies describing chatbot development (n=18) were the most prevalent, and only 11 randomized controlled trials were identified. The 3 most commonly reported conversational agent applications in the literature were treatment and monitoring, health care service support, and patient education. Conclusions: The literature on conversational agents in health care is largely descriptive and aimed at treatment and monitoring and health service support. It mostly reports on text-based, artificial intelligence-driven, and smartphone app-delivered conversational agents. There is an urgent need for a robust evaluation of diverse health care conversational agents' formats, focusing on their acceptability, safety, and effectiveness. © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

The tutor uses a commercial eye tracker to monitor a students gaze patterns and identify when the student is bored, disengaged, or is zoning out. The tutor then attempts to reengage the student with dialog moves that direct the student to reorient his or her attentional patterns towards the animated pedagogical agent embodying the tutor. We evaluated the efficacy of the gaze-reactive tutor in promoting learning, motivation, and engagement in a controlled experiment where 48 students were tutored on four biology topics with both gaze-reactive and non-gaze-reactive (control condition) versions of the tutor. The results indicated that: (a) gaze-sensitive dialogs were successful in dynamically reorienting students' attentional patterns to the important areas of the interface, (b) gaze-reactivity was effective in promoting learning gains for questions that required deep reasoning, (c) gaze-reactivity had minimal impact on students' state motivation and on self-reported engagement, and (d) individual differences in scholastic aptitude moderated the impact of gaze-reactivity on overall learning gains. We discuss the implications of our findings, limitations, future work, and consider the possibility of using gaze-reactive ITSs in classrooms. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Affect-sensitive ITS; Affective computing; Boredom; Disengagement; Eye tracking; Gaze-sensitive dialogs; Intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs); Zoning out,Computer aided instruction; Education computing; Interface states; Motivation; Students; Zoning; Affect-sensitive ITS; Affective Computing; Boredom; Disengagement; Eye-tracking; Gaze-sensitive dialogs; Intelligent tutoring system; Teaching,,,,,"US Department of Education; National Science Foundation, NSF, (DRL 1108845, HCC 0834847); National Science Foundation, NSF; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE, (R305A080594); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Institute of Education Sciences, IES","This research was supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) ( HCC 0834847 and DRL 1108845 ) and Institute of Education Sciences (IES), US Department of Education (DoE) , through Grant R305A080594 .

One promising development in this field is the use of generative artificial intelligence technology, such as the ChatGPT conversational agent. ChatGPT has the potential to offer personalized and effective learning experiences by providing students with customized feedback and explanations, as well as creating realistic virtual simulations for hands-on learning. However, it is important to also consider the limitations of this technology. ChatGPT and other generative AI systems are only as good as their training data and may perpetuate biases or even generate and spread misinformation. Additionally, the use of generative AI in education raises ethical concerns such as the potential for unethical or dishonest use by students and the potential unemployment of humans who are made redundant by technology. While the current state of generative AI technology represented by ChatGPT is impressive but flawed, it is only a preview of what is to come. It is important for engineering educators to understand the implications of this technology and study how to adapt the engineering education ecosystem to ensure that the next generation of engineers can take advantage of the benefits offered by generative AI while minimizing any negative consequences.  © 2023 IEEE.",ChatGPT; Engineering Education; Generative AI,Students; Artificial intelligence technologies; Changing needs; ChatGPT; Conversational agents; Effective learning; Engineering industries; Generative AI; Learning experiences; Personalized learning; Technological development; Engineering education,,,,,,,"Qadir J., Taha A.-E.M., Yau K.-L.A., Ponciano J., Hussain S., Al-Fuqaha A., Imran M.A., Leveraging the force of formative assessment & feedback for effective engineering education, American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) Annual Conference, (2020); Thunstrom A., We asked GPT-3 to write an academic paper about itself: Then we tried to get it published, Scientific American, 30, (2022); Stokel-Walker C., AI bot ChatGPT writes smart essays-should professors worry; Susnjak T., ChatGPT: The End of Online Exam Integrity, (2022); Bender E.M., Gebru T., McMillan-Major A., Shmitchell S., On the dangers of stochastic parrots: Can language models be too big, Proceedings of the 2021 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency, pp. 610-623, (2021); Qadir J., Islam M.Q., Al-Fuqaha A., Toward accountable humancentered AI: Rationale and promising directions, Journal of Information, Communication and Ethics in Society, (2022); Latif S., Qayyum A., Usama M., Qadir J., Zwitter A., Shahzad M., Caveat emptor: The risks of using big data for human development, IEEE Technology and Society Magazine, 38, 3, pp. 82-90, (2019); Welsh M., The end of programming, Communications of the ACM, 66, 1, pp. 34-35, (2022); Mander J., Four arguments for the elimination of television, (1978); Carr N., The shallows: How the internet is changing the way we think, read and remember, (2010); Gilbert I., Why Do I Need a Teacher When I've got Google: The essential guide to the big issues for every teacher, Routledge, (2014); Pappano L., The year of the MOOC, The New York Times, 2, 12, (2012); Kent M., Bennett R., What was all that about Peak MOOC hype and post-MOOC legacies, Massive Open Online Courses and Higher Education, pp. 1-8, (2017); Brynjolfsson E., McAfee A., The second machine age: Work, progress, and prosperity in a time of brilliant technologies, WW Norton & Company, (2014); Ahmad K., Qadir J., Al-Fuqaha A., Iqbal W., El-Hassan A., Benhaddou D., Ayyash M., Data-driven artificial intelligence in education: A comprehensive review, (2020); Wollny S., Schneider J., Di Mitri D., Weidlich J., Rittberger M., Drachsler H., Are we there yet-a systematic literature review on chatbots in education, Frontiers in artificial intelligence, 4, (2021); Litman D., Natural language processing for enhancing teaching and learning, Thirtieth AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, (2016); Qadir J., The triple imperatives of online teaching: Equity, inclusion, and effectiveness, International Journal of Pluralism and Economics Education, 12, (2021); Qadir J., Al-Fuqaha A., A Student Primer on How to Thrive in Engineering Education during and beyond COVID-19, Education Sciences, 10, 9, (2020); Qadir J., What every student should know: Seven learning impediments and their remedies, IEEE Potentials, 34, 3, pp. 30-35, (2015); Qadir J., Imran M.A., Learning 101: The untaught basics, IEEE Potentials, 37, 3, pp. 33-38, (2018); Borji A., A categorical archive of ChatGPT failures, (2023); Toyama K., Geek heresy: Rescuing social change from the cult of technology, (2015); Rothstein D., Santana L., Make just one change: Teach students to ask their own questions, (2011); Qadir J., Yau K.-L.A., Imran M.A., Al-Fuqaha A., Engineering education, moving into 2020s: Essential competencies for effective 21st century electrical & computer engineers, 2020 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE), pp. 1-9, (2020); Kleon A., Steal Like an Artist, (2022); Cabanac G., Labbe C., Magazinov A., Tortured phrases: A dubious writing style emerging in science. evidence of critical issues affecting established journals, (2021); Reich J., Failure to disrupt: Why technology alone can't transform education, (2020)","J.

AutoTutor is an intelligent tutoring system that helps students compose explanations of difficult concepts in Newtonian physics and enhances computer literacy and critical thinking by interacting with them in natural language with adaptive dialog moves similar to those of human tutors. AutoTutor constructs a cognitive model of students knowledge levels by analyzing the text of their typed or spoken responses to its questions. The model is used to dynamically tailor the interaction toward individual students zones of proximal development. Affective AutoTutor takes the individualized instruction and human-like interactivity to a new level by automatically detecting and responding to students emotional states in addition to their cognitive states. Over 20 controlled experiments comparing AutoTutor with ecological and experimental controls such reading a textbook have consistently yielded learning improvements of approximately one letter grade after brief 3060-minute interactions. Furthermore, Affective AutoTutor shows even more dramatic improvements in learning than the original AutoTutor system, particularly for struggling students with low domain knowledge. In addition to providing a detailed description of the implementation and evaluation of AutoTutor and Affective AutoTutor, we also discuss new and exciting technologies motivated by AutoTutor such as AutoTutor-Lite, Operation ARIES, GuruTutor, DeepTutor, MetaTutor, and AutoMentor.We conclude this article with our vision for future work on interactive and engaging intelligent tutoring systems. © 2012 ACM.",Affect detection and synthesis; Affective computing; Constructivism; Deep learning; Intelligent tutoring systems; Natural language understanding; Student modeling; User modeling,Computer aided instruction; Computer science; Education computing; Intelligent systems; Affect detection; Affective Computing; Constructivism; Deep learning; Intelligent tutoring system; Natural language understanding; Student Modeling; User Modeling; Students,,,,,,,"Afzal S., Robinson P., Natural affect data: Collection and annotation, New Perspectives on Affect and Learning Technologies, pp. 44-70, (2011); Aleven V., Koedinger K., An effective metacognitive strategy: Learning by doing and explaining with a computer-based cognitive tutor, Cogn.

The review aims at answering three basic questions on student modeling: what to model, how and why. The prevailing student modeling approaches that have been used in the past 10 years are described, the aspects of students' characteristics that were taken into consideration are presented and how a student model can be used in order to provide adaptivity and personalisation in computer-based educational software is highlighted. This paper aims to provide important information to researchers, educators and software developers of computer-based educational software ranging from e-learning and mobile learning systems to educational games including stand alone educational applications and intelligent tutoring systems. In addition, this paper can be used as a guide for making decisions about the techniques that should be adopted when designing a student model for an adaptive tutoring system. One significant conclusion is that the most preferred technique for representing the student's mastery of knowledge is the overlay approach. Also, stereotyping seems to be ideal for modeling students' learning styles and preferences. Furthermore, affective student modeling has had a rapid growth over the past years, while it has been noticed an increase in the adoption of fuzzy techniques and Bayesian networks in order to deal the uncertainty of student modeling. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A computerised content analysis was conducted to examine how AI and DL research themes have evolved in major educational journals. By doing so, we seek to uncover the prominent keywords associated with AI-enabled pedagogical adaptation research in each decade, due to the discipline's dynamism. By examining the major research themes and historical trends from 2000 to 2019, we demonstrate that, as advanced technologies in education evolve over time, some areas of research topics seem have stood the test of time, while some others have experienced peaks and valleys. More importantly, our analysis highlights the paradigm shifts and emergent trends that are gaining prominence in the field of educational research. For instance, the results suggest the decline in conventional tech-enabled instructional design research and the flourishing of student profiling models and learning analytics. Furthermore, this paper serves to raise awareness on the opportunities and challenges behind AI and DL for pedagogical adaptation and initiate a dialogue. © 2020 KeAi Communications Co., Ltd",Artificial intelligence; Educational data mining; Intelligent tutoring systems; Systematic review; Virtual reality,,,,,,"Pusan National University, PNU, (202004140001)",This work was supported by Pusan National University Research Grant ( 202004140001 ). ,"Abbott R.G., Automated expert modeling for automated student evaluation, International Conference on Intelligent Tutoring Systems, pp. 1-10, (2006); Alam M.M., Mohiuddin K., Das A.K., Islam M.K., Kaonain M.S., Ali M.H., March).

Our focus is on the development and current uses of chatbots in the field of education, where they can function as service assistants or as educational agents. In this research paper, we attempt to make a systematic review of the literature on educational chatbots that address various issues. From 485 sources, 80 studies on chatbots and their application in education were selected through a step-by-step procedure based on the guidelines of the PRISMA framework, using a set of predefined criteria. The results obtained demonstrate the existence of different types of educational chatbots currently in use that affect student learning or improve services in various areas. This paper also examines the type of technology used to unravel the learning outcome that can be obtained from each type of chatbots. Finally, our results identify instances where a chatbot can assist in learning under conditions similar to those of a human tutor, while exploring other possibilities and techniques for assessing the quality of chatbots. Our analysis details these findings and can provide a solid framework for research and development of chatbots for the educational field. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC",chatbot; conversational agent; educational bot; literature review; natural language processor,Computer science; Application in education; Educational agents; Learning outcome; Research and development; Step by step procedure; Systematic literature review; Systematic Review; Type of technology; Engineering,,,,,,,"Arsovski S., Et al., Automatic knowledge extraction of any chatbot from conversation, Expert Syst.

All studies (k = 92) compared learning outcomes of students using digital tools to those of a control group taught without the use of digital tools. Overall, digital tool use had a positive effect on student learning outcomes (g = 0.65, p < .001). The provision of teacher trainings on digital tool use significantly moderated the overall effect. Use of intelligent tutoring systems or simulations such as dynamic mathematical tools was significantly more beneficial than hypermedia systems. On a descriptive level, the effect size was larger when digital tools were used in addition to other instruction methods and not as a substitute. The results open up new directions for future research and can inform evidence-based decision-making on the use of digital tools in education. © 2020 The Authors",Computer-based science learning; Mathematics; Media in education; Meta-analysis; Secondary education,Computer aided instruction; Decision making; Digital devices; Hypermedia systems; Evidence- based decisions; Instruction methods; Intelligent tutoring system; Mathematical tools; Science learning; Secondary schools; Student learning outcomes; Systematic research; E-learning,,,,,Stiftung Mercator,"This research was supported by grants from the Stiftung Mercator , Essen, Germany.

However, despite decades of research on scaffolding in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education, no existing comprehensive meta-analysis has synthesized the results of these studies. This review addresses that need by synthesizing the results of 144 experimental studies (333 outcomes) on the effects of computer-based scaffolding designed to assist the full range of STEM learners (primary through adult education) as they navigated ill-structured, problem-centered curricula. Results of our random effect meta-analysis (a) indicate that computer-based scaffolding showed a consistently positive (ḡ = 0.46) effect on cognitive outcomes across various contexts of use, scaffolding characteristics, and levels of assessment and (b) shed light on many scaffolding debates, including the roles of customization (i.e., fading and adding) and context-specific support. Specifically, scaffolding’s influence on cognitive outcomes did not vary on the basis of context-specificity, presence or absence of scaffolding change, and logic by which scaffolding change is implemented. Scaffolding’s influence was greatest when measured at the principles level and among adult learners. Still scaffolding’s effect was substantial and significantly greater than zero across all age groups and assessment levels. These results suggest that scaffolding is a highly effective intervention across levels of different characteristics and can largely be designed in many different ways while still being highly effective. © 2016, © 2016 AERA.",cognitive tutor; intelligent tutoring systems; meta-analysis; problem-based instruction; problem-centered instruction; scaffold; STEM,,,,,,"Directorate for Education and Human Resources, EHR, (1251782); Directorate for Education and Human Resources, EHR",,"Abrami P.C., Bernard R.M., Borokhovski E., Waddington D.I., Wade C.A., Persson T., Strategies for teaching students to think critically: A meta-analysis, Review of Educational Research, 85, pp. 275-314, (2015); Abrami P.C., Bernard R.M., Borokhovski E., Wade A., Surkes M.A., Tamim R., Zhang D., Instructional interventions affecting critical thinking skills and dispositions: A Stage 1 meta-analysis, Review of Educational Research, 78, pp. 1102-1134, (2008); Albanese M., Problem-based learning: Why curricula are likely to show little effect on knowledge and clinical skills, Medical Education, 34, pp. 729-738, (2000); Alexander P.A., Thinking critically and analytically about critical-analytic thinking: An introduction, Educational Psychology Review, 26, pp. 469-476, (2014); Alias N.A., Design of a motivational scaffold for the Malaysian e-Learning environment, Journal of Educational Technology & Society, 15, pp. 137-151, (2012); Ardac D., Sezen A.H., Effectiveness of computer-based chemistry instruction in enhancing the learning of content and variable control under guided versus unguided conditions, Journal of Science Education and Technology, 11, pp. 39-48, (2002); Aydin E., Cagiltay N., A new RF and microwave engineering course enriched with advanced technologies, Computer Applications in Engineering Education, 20, pp. 634-645, (2012); Barab S.A., Squire K.D., Dueber W., A co-evolutionary model for supporting the emergence of authenticity, Educational Technology Research & Development, 48, 2, pp. 37-62, (2000); Belland B.R., Distributed cognition as a lens to understand the effects of scaffolds: The role of transfer of responsibility, Educational Psychology Review, 23, pp. 577-600, (2011); Belland B.R., French B.F., Ertmer P.A., Validity and problem-based learning research: A review of instruments used to assess intended learning outcomes, Interdisciplinary Journal of Problem-Based Learning, 3, pp. 59-89, (2009); Belland B.R., Kim C., Hannafin M., A framework for designing scaffolds that improve motivation and cognition, Educational Psychologist, 48, pp. 243-270, (2013); Belland B.R., Walker A., Olsen M.W., Leary H., A pilot meta-analysis of computer-based scaffolding in STEM education, Educational Technology and Society, 18, pp. 183-197, (2015); Bernard R.M., Abrami P.C., Lou Y., Borokhovski E., Wade A., Wozney L., Huang B., How does distance education compare with classroom instruction?

Because creativity has become an essential skill in the current e-learning epoch, this study aims to develop a personalized creativity learning system (PCLS) that is based on the data mining technique of decision trees to provide personalized learning paths for optimizing the performance of creativity. The PCLS includes a series of creativity tasks as well as a questionnaire regarding several key variables. Ninety-two college students were included in this study to examine the effectiveness of the PCLS. The experimental results show that, when the learning path suggested by a hybrid decision tree is employed, the learners have a 90% probability of obtaining an above-average creativity score, which suggests that the employed data mining technique can be a good vehicle for providing adaptive learning that is related to creativity. Moreover, the findings in this study shed light on what components should be accounted for when designing a personalized creativity learning system as well as how to integrate personalized learning and game-based learning into a creative learning program to maximize learner motivation and learning effects. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we review the development, key research findings, and systems that have evolved from AutoTutor. First, the rationale for developing AutoTutor is outlined and the advantages of natural language tutoring are presented. Next, we review three central themes in AutoTutor's development: human-inspired tutoring strategies, pedagogical agents, and technologies that support natural-language tutoring. Research on early versions of AutoTutor documented the impact on deep learning by co-constructed explanations, feedback, conversational scaffolding, and subject matter content. Systems that evolved from AutoTutor added additional components that have been evaluated with respect to learning and motivation. The latter findings include the effectiveness of deep reasoning questions for tutoring multiple domains, of adapting to the affect of low-knowledge learners, of content over surface features such as voices and persona of animated agents, and of alternative tutoring strategies such as collaborative lecturing and vicarious tutoring demonstrations. The paper also considers advances in pedagogical agent roles (such as trialogs) and in tutoring technologies, such semantic processing and tutoring delivery platforms. This paper summarizes and integrates significant findings produced by studies using AutoTutor and related systems. © 2014 International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.",AutoTutor; Computer-assisted learning; Discourse processes; Intelligent tutoring systems; Natural language processing; Pedagogical agents,Computer aided instruction; Deep learning; E-learning; Scaffolds; Semantics; Teaching; Autotutor; Computer assisted learning; Computer literacy; Critical thinking; Intelligent tutoring system; Natural languages; Pedagogical agents; Semantic processing; Natural language processing systems,,,,,"ONR STEM Grand Challenge, (N00014-12-C-0643); National Science Foundation, (0325428, 0834847, 0904909, 0918409, 1108845, 633918); Office of Naval Research; Institute of Education Sciences, (R305A080594, R305A090528, R305A100875, R305C120001, R305G020018); Educational Testing Service; Army Research Laboratory","Acknowledgments This work has been supported by grants from the National Science Foundation (NSF grants 0325428, 633918, 0834847, 0918409, 1108845, 0834847, 0904909, 0918409, 1108845), Institute of Education Sciences (IES grants R305A080594, R305G020018, R305C120001, R305A090528, R305A100875), Office of Naval Research (ONR STEM Grand Challenge: N00014-12-C-0643), Army Research Lab (N00014-12-C-0643), and the Educational Testing Service.
